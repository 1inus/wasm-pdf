# PACK-PDF
## Generate PDF files from JSON with WASM (WebAssembly).

The aim of this project is to make a WASM PDF generator library, which is able to generate simple PDF files with ease and also a bit more complicated PDF's with tables etc.

This library already works, but is at a prototype stage, so I don't recommend using it in anything serious yet.
